			<p>
				<b>Racial harassment</b> is unwelcome behavior that happens to you because of your race, color, or national origin, such as verbal or physical conduct of a racial nature. It is a form of discrimination that violates Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
			</p>
			<p>
				Racial harassment in the workplace is unlawful when 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) when the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a person would consider intimidating, hostile or abusive. This is also called hostile environment harassment. (<a href="https://www.workplacefairness.org/race-harassment" target="_blank">Source</a>)
