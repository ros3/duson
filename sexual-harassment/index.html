				<b>Sexual harassment</b> refers to unwelcome sexual advances, comments of a sexual nature, requests for sexual favors, and harassment or comments about an individual’s gender, all of which create a hostile work environment. Most commonly, sexual harassment is perpetrated by someone in a position of authority over the victim, such as an employer, supervisor, or teacher.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sexual harassment is illegal in the U.S., defined and governed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). (<a href="https://legaldictionary.net/sexual-harassment/" target="_blank">Source</a>)
