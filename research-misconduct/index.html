			<h3>Misconduct Review Officer</h3>
			<p>
				If you have reason to believe that research misconduct might have occurred, you must report the matter to the misconduct review officer (MRO), your department chair or division chief, dean, or other appropriate institutional official. Allegations brought to individuals other than a MRO will be promptly forwarded to the MRO.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you are unsure whether a suspected incident falls within the definition of research misconduct, you may contact the MRO to discuss the suspected research misconduct informally, which may include discussing it anonymously and/or hypothetically.
			</p>

			<p>
				If the circumstances you describe do not meet the definition of research misconduct, the MRO will refer you or the allegation to other offices or officials with responsibility for resolving the problem. At any time, you may have confidential discussions and consultations about concerns of possible misconduct with the MRO to discuss options and available procedures.
			</p>

			<h3>Integrity Line</h3>
			
			<p>
				Questions and concerns about research misconduct can also be reported through the Integrity Line: 1-800-826-8109. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The Integrity Line is a telephone hotline open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You can call the hotline to report a concern without giving a name. Calls will not be traced. If you want to leave your name to help answer questions about the situation, the information will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law and/or institutional policies.
