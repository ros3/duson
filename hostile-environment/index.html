				Academic settings should be challenging, but it should not be traumatic or hostile (<a href="../challenging-not-traumatic.pdf" target="_blank">see article</a> on this distinction). A hostile environment is one in which poor communication, gossip, scolding or blaming, favoritism, coercion, competition, back-stabbing, manipulation, and/or abuse occur on a regular basis.
			</p>		
		
			<p>
				If you are experiencing a hostile environment created or exacerbated by <a href="../sexual-harassment/">sexual</a>, <a href="../race-harassment-discrimination/">race-based</a>, or <a href="../gender-harassment-discrimination/">gender-based harassment</a>, please see the sections on addressing those types of situations.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				If you are experiencing a hostile environment due to other hostilities or power dynamic concerns, the <a href="../department-school-intervention/">next step</a> is to speak to your advisor, supervisor, division chair, or assistant dean of your program.
