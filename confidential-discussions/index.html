				In this guide, some offices or personnel are labeled "Confidential." That means students can discuss concerns with those offices or personnel and the information will not be reported to the Office of Student Conduct or the Office for Institutional Equity. Confidential resources will not share information about a report without the individual’s express written permission unless there is a continuing threat of harm to the complainant or to others or there is a legal obligation to reveal such information (e.g., suspected abuse or neglect of a minor).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Depending on who you feel comfortable talking to, there are a number of confidential resources available to you. Click on the buttons on this page to learn more and connect with each of these resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="red"><b>With the exception of these confidential resources, all employees who become aware of prohibited conduct are expected to notify the Office of Student Conduct with the names of the parties involved and the details of the report. Students who serve in an ongoing peer-advising role are also expected to report such conduct to the Office of Student Conduct.</b></span>
