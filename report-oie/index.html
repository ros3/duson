				<li>The appropriate deans in The Graduate School will be notified, and they will reach out to the leadership of your program.</li>
				<li>The investigator will conduct interviews with all involved parties, and with witnesses if needed.</li>
				<li>The investigator will write a report of findings â€“ the report will get sent to the involved parties.</li>
				<li>A report will be archived in OIE. It will also be shared with you (i.e., the person who filed the report) and the appropriate Graduate School leadership.</li>
