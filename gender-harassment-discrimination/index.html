			<p>
				<b>Gender harassment</b>, or gender-based harassment, is a form of sex discrimination. It occurs when one person harasses another person for reasons relating to their gender identity. The harassment conduct, however, does not need to be based on anything of a sexual nature. Instead, gender harassment generally involves stereotypes according to the roles and functions associated with a particular gender. The behavior of the harasser creates a hostile work environment for people of a specific gender.
